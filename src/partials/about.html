          Ice cream is a complex product. Dairy ice cream contains milk fat, and
          other components, such as proteins and carbohydrates.
        </p>
        <p class="about-txt__second-p">
          Sweeteners, flavourings, emulsifiers and stabilisers are added during
          processing to enhance flavour, texture or appearance. Ice cream is
          over 50% water, from milk or other ingredients.

        <p class="about-txt__third-p">
          Air is incorporated into the product, resulting in finely distributed
          air cells protected by a layer of fat globules.

      The production of ice cream involves mixing the ingredients together,
      followed by pasteurisation. It is then homogenised, a process that allows
      the distribution of fat into as many separate small fat globules as
      possible. After homogenisation there is a cooling and ageing process. The
      mixture is left to age for 4-24 hours and during this time all the dry
      ingredients are hydrated and the fat is crystallised. The product is then
      frozen in a continuous freezer and air incorporation takes place. When the
      ice cream leaves the continuous freezer at -5˚C, approximately 50% of the
      water is frozen. The final process is hardening, which freezes out most of
      the water at -40˚C.
